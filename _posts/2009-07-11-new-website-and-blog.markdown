I finally made my new blog to replace my old forum-dependant website. I built the blog engine from scratch in Ruby on Rails (and no, it's not just like the one in the tutorial on rubyonrails.org) in a week. If there is enough interest, I will release the source. It is dependant on one gem other than Rails: Authlogic.

There are still things missing on this website that I will put up later. One thing I'm wondering is whether or not I should add some of my <s>old content</s> (that might still be useful) on this blog or not.
