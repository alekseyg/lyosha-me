I just want to break the silence and wish everyone a merry Christmas, happy New Year, and all the other holidays you might enjoy this season. Personally, I don't celebrate any other winter holidays, but I do believe some others, such as Hanukkah, are great holidays.

I haven't blogged in a really long time. I am always busy working on many things and often neglect my own projects. I wanted to say some things that have happened and are coming up for my website (which nobody is interested in anyway) and other things I am working on.

Most of the things I have done so far on my blog is behind the scenes. I have improved spam management and fixed a bug in which spam messages, though not visible, were counted with the legitimate comments on the home page.

If anyone is interested, I will release my blog source on Github. I know that the open source world has many blogging systems already, but none of the Rails systems seemed to cut it for me when I set mine up, so I wrote my own. I think we can build a good system with this base if there is interest.

I am going to add some of my more useful content from my old blog here and delete my forums. I will also add a proper portfolio on my website where I can include my graphic design work, art, etc.

As for other projects, I plan on letting members on Bryte Youth to log into their accounts and start interacting on the website some time in January. I know it's been a long time since I started development and have estimated incorrectly many times when it will be ready for use, but don't worry, it will be ready soon ("soon" is the favorite release date for programmers).

I have also been put in charge of the technical side of Anime Angels. I have plans on greatly revamping that website too. I don't know when or if that might happen, but if it's the Lord's will, it will happen. We are also getting ready to release a new magazine issue to mark 10 years of Anime Angels: a rather long time for an online community. I pray it will continue strong as it has over the past 10 years.
