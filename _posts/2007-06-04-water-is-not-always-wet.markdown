Yesterday (it's past midnight (1:30AM), so forgive me if I say something crazy) it's been one year since my group and I got baptized. Before getting baptized, one of the men who worked with us promised us that the water would be wet in the river. Thinking back to that day and discussing it with another person who got baptized the same day, we came to the conclusion that the water was exactly how the man promised us. But discussing the matter further, my friend argued that water is always wet so the promise was easy for him to keep. However, I have found proof that that is not always so; one of the largest distributors of dehydrated water, [buydehydratedwater.com](http://www.buydehydratedwater.com/) sells hundreds of gallons of dehydrated water daily. So water is NOT always wet.
