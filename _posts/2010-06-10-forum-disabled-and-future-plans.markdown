I disabled the forum I used to have as it's been unused for about a year and has served its purpose. Also, since I don't really do much on my website anyway, in the future I plan to make it more of a gateway to places where I am more active and have it aggregate my activity there. The only exception is I will probably still host a portfolio on here.
